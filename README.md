## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION

`The console` is part of a series of projects related to the overarching `Airbnb clone` project. When complete, these projects will combine to form a fully functioning **Airbnb clone website** (short several features available on the actual [Airbnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/)).

The objective of this project then is to build out a **command interpreter**, with a specific use-case, that is to manage objects of this `Airbnb clone` project. The interpreter's tasks/ functions are as follows:

- Create a new object (e.g. a new `User` or a new `Place`).
- Store and persist objects to a file, a database, etc.
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
- Do operations on objects (e.g. count, compute, stats, etc.).
- Update attributes of an object.
- Destroy an object.

#### COMMAND INTERPRETER DESCRIPTION

As metioned above, the command interpreter is used to manage/ manipulate data (the Python objects), and this without a visual interface, on a powerful storage system used to persist the data.
